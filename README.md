## Speech Recognition Providers

- **Reverie Language AI** (Recommended for Indian regional languages, healthcare/clinical use, real-time streaming)
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Browser Speech API (for development/testing)

To use Reverie, obtain API credentials from [Reverie](https://docs.reverieinc.com/) and select it in the app's speech provider settings.

## Environment Variables

To use Reverie in production, set your API credentials in a `.env` file or your deployment environment:

```
REVERIE_API_ID=dev.bibhutimailx
REVERIE_API_KEY=d269788c46c29e5b8c30d28486fdfc20288ba521
```

Make sure your deployment process injects these variables securely. The app will use these credentials when Reverie is selected as the speech provider.
